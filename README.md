# tweet-sentiment-classification
Initially developed to retrieve sentiment towards a particular topic on Twitter given topic name. Fetches 100 most recent tweets regarding the query and processes the information by feeding it into transformer BERTSqUAD16 and returning that information. Leverages Twitter's Developer Program to navigate and fetch 100 tweets real-time, utilizing Application Program Interfaces or APIs.

# Next Steps
Extending the concept of fetching data from Twitter feeds to extracting intelligence from Twitter regarding a topic by providing not just sentiment, but also summary of what is being said, certain details, and action steps regarding the information. This will be highly benefitial for trading / investment news. Kind of like market watching.
